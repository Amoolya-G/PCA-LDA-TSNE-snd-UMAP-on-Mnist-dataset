Principal component analysis (PCA) is the process of computing the principal components and using them to perform a change of basis on the data, sometimes using only the first few principal components and ignoring the rest.
I have done PCA on Mnist dataset and you can see the code in my codefile.
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is most commonly used as dimensionality reduction technique in the pre-processing step for pattern-classification and machine learning applications.

t-SNE is something called nonlinear dimensionality reduction. What that means is this algorithm allows us to separate data that cannot be separated by any straight line.
Tsne is very slow compared to other codes. So you might have to wait a long time to get the output. If you want to check whether code is correct or not, try giving less samples and run it. Thats why UMAP came into existence.
UMAP is a new technique by McInnes et al. that offers a number of advantages over t-SNE, most notably increased speed and better preservation of the data's global structure.
